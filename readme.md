### SSD Assignment-3-B
**1.)** 
**DIFFERENCES**
- **Input format -** A string of IDs is taken as input which if splitted to form a list, `delimiter=" "`
- Root to node path for each input ID is stored in a 2D list, `(line 24-36)`, Algo is same as earlier, only storage method is different.
- Loop invariant conditon is still same, but its implementation is in a different way due to different storage method. `(line 42-46)`
- Leader finding method is same, but this time it is applied on the 2D list instead of strings in ealier case `(line 46-54)`
- For finding common leader, I stored path to parent for both nodes in 2 strings.

**STILL SAME**
- Last common character in 2 string from `left` is the common leader
- **Assumption - Root is assumed to have no parent. So if any of the 2 inputs is root, then no solution is possible in that case.**

**2.)** 
**DIFFERENCES**
- Only `processDate()` method is updated. `(line 61-65)`

**STILL SAME**
- `daysbefore()` and `isLeap()`functions are unchanged.
- ANSWER = (1) + (2) + #Days in years between the years of 2 dates

**3.)** 
**DIFFERENCES**
- Run program as `python3 q3.py Employee1.txt Employee2.txt` You can give any number of filenames as the command line argumnets. **All files should be in same folder as the program**
- Filenames are given as command line arguments
- Information is stored in different manner, 1D and 2D lists are used this time for all kind of intermediate and final information needed to solve the problem
- `sys` library is used for command line arguments
- `isDateSame()` is updated to handle any number of data `(line 4-14)`
- `getName()` is new method used to get `name` of employee in the file `(line 72-75)`. **This part is missing the ASSG 3-A.**
- Input processing is changed `(line 82-104)`
- Algorithm to calculate common free slot `(line 124-150)` is updated to work on 1D and 2D lists

**STILL SAME**
- File is read in a string
- String is processed to extract date and busy time slots.
- Free time slots are calculated for each employee
- **ALL free time slots are converted to minutes and then algorithm is performed.**
- `inMin()` and `process()` functions are unchanged `(line 26-70)`
- Algorithm is a modification of merge algorithm of merge sort.
- **If dates are not same in 2 files, then "NO FREE SLOT IS AVAILABLE"**
- **In output, slot duration is displayed as floating number, like 0.5 instead of 1/2**
- **Same alogorithm is applied this time as well. Only difference is of using different data structures in it.**
